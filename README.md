# Wraith Helper

**Wraith Helper** is a Geometry Dash mod for **Wraith** that adds a convenient in-game button to view all available codes and keeps track of the ones youâ€™ve already redeemed.

## ðŸ§¾ About

I originally created this mod just for my own convenience, but Iâ€™ve made it public so newer players can easily keep track of codes, too.
