# Wraith Helper

A Geometry Dash mod for Wraith that adds a convenient in-game button to view all available codes and keeps track of the ones you've already redeemed.


## Features

- **In-game CODES button** in the vault interface for easy access
- **Progress tracking** showing how many codes you've redeemed (X/Y format)
- **Checkbox system** to mark codes as completed
- **Pagination** for easy navigation through all available codes
- **Auto-input functionality** - click codes to automatically input them
- **Persistent storage** - your progress is saved between sessions

## How to Use

1. Go to the Wraith vault in Geometry Dash
2. Click the "CODES" button in the top-right corner
3. Browse through the codes using pagination
4. Click on any code to automatically input it into the vault
5. Checkboxes automatically track your progress

## Planned Features

i will be adding (eventually):
* [ ] **Auto Code Repo**: Integrate an online repository for automatic code updates.
* [ ] **Global Stats**: Show community-wide redemption stats for each code. (Might be a stretch, but fun!)

I originally created this mod just for my own convenience, but I've made it public so newer players can easily keep track of codes, too!
