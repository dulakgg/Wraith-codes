Wraith Helper

A Geometry Dash mod for Wraith that adds a convenient in-game button to view all available codes and keeps track of the ones you’ve already redeemed.

i will be adding (eventually):
* [ ] **Auto Code Repo**: Integrate an online repository for automatic code updates.
* [ ] **Global Stats**: Show community-wide redemption stats for each code. (Might be a stretch, but fun!)

I originally created this mod just for my own convenience, but I’ve made it public so newer players can easily keep track of codes, too!
